##TF â€“ TFLITE:

##Note: TF 2.3 has some bugs while doing tflite conversion. TF2.4 has fixes. So make sure that TF version is atleast 2.4. Also check TF models repository as new files are added.

Steps: First create a SAVED MODEL by using this CMD. 
Converting Model (SAVEDMODEL) created by TF OBJ API directly wont work. 
TF has provided additional script to convert Object Detection Api 
SAVEDMODEL to TFLITE compatible SAVEDMODEL.

python3 export_tflite_graph_tf2.py \
    --pipeline_config_path trained_models/ssd_v2/pipeline.config \
    --trained_checkpoint_dir trained_models/ssd_v2/checkpoint \
    --output_directory tflite_models/saved_models

export_tflite_graph_tf2.py is available in TF OBJ API so TF OBJ API installation is required.
